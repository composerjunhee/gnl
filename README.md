# Get Next Line
## Overview
In this project, the main objective is to create a function that reads a file descriptor and returns a line from that file. This task will help you understand the process of reading and opening files in an operating system and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis. Developing this function is essential for future programmers who will be dealing with data management and persistence in their projects. The function must be able to read one line at a time from a text file.

## Requirements
To execute this project, you need to write the function in the C programming language, and you will require the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run the function.
